/**
 * ChatGPT trying to explain this to a 5 yr old:
 * Think of layer normalization like a game where everyone gets a turn to speak equally.
 * In a computer's brain, when it's learning or deciding something, some parts may talk too loudly or too softly.
 * Layer normalization is like a rule in the game that helps every part speak at a nice, even level, so the computer can understand things better and make smarter choices.
 * It's like making sure everyone in a circle gets to share their story without anyone being too loud or too quiet.
 *
 * One of the steps in a Transformer block is to apply layer normalization to this matrix.
 * This is an operation that normalizes the values in each column of the matrix separately.
