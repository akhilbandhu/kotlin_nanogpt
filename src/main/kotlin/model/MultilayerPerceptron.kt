/**
 * MLP, also known as matrix multiplication in machine learning
 *
 * After prodding ChatGPT:
 * Yes, at its core, an MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) largely involves matrix multiplication.
 * Each neuron's output is computed as a weighted sum of its inputs, which is a form of matrix multiplication.
 * These results are then typically passed through a non-linear function (like a sigmoid or ReLU function).
 * So, while matrix multiplication is a key part of how an MLP processes data,
 * it also involves additional steps like applying non-linear transformations and aggregating these computations across multiple layers.
